  Scenario: Portfolio optimization for bolt hammer with Portfolio level constraint
    Given I set the min portfolio constraint "-20" % and max portfolio constraint "20" %
    Given I fetch the optimization payload
    Given I fetch and store the actual scenario details
    When I run optimization for the scenario
    And I updated the scenario with optimized spends
    And I fetch and store optimized scenario details
    Then I assert optimized portfolio spend greater than zero
    Then I assert optimized portfolio spend is within min "-20.01" % and max "20.01" % range
    # TODO Check assertion - Failing
#    And I assert optimized selected kpi's mroi to be equal for all instruments across markets

  Scenario: Portfolio optimization for bolt hammer with Market Level Constraint
    Given I set the min market constraint "-20" % and max market constraint "40" %
    Given I fetch the optimization payload
    Given I fetch and store the actual scenario details
    When I run optimization for the scenario
    And I updated the scenario with optimized spends
    And I fetch and store optimized scenario details
    Then I assert optimized portfolio spend greater than zero
    Then I assert optimized market spends greater than zero
    Then I assert optimized market spend is within min "-20.01" % and max "40.01" % range
  # TODO Check assertion - Failing
#    And I assert optimized selected kpi mroi to be equal for all instruments for each market

  Scenario: Portfolio optimization for bolt hammer with Instrument Level Constraints for all instruments
    Given I set the min instrument constraint "-20" % and max instrument constraint "20" % for all instruments
    Given I fetch the optimization payload
    Given I fetch and store the actual scenario details
    When I run optimization for the scenario
    And I updated the scenario with optimized spends
    And I fetch and store optimized scenario details
    Then I assert optimized portfolio spend greater than zero
    Then I assert optimized instrument spends to be within the given range
    And I assert optimized selected kpi's mroi to be equal for the instruments with spends not on the min-max extremes and MROI not equal to zero
